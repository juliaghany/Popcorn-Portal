# Popcorn Portal

## Description
-Our motivation for this project was to create an application that presents information on movies based upon the user’s search. It will present information such as rating, general description of the movie, featured actors, the director, genre, year of release, and reviews. It will also include a feature that tells the user where they can stream the movie that they’ve searched. The user will also be able to save specific movies that they’d like to watch in the future. 

-We built this project to practice writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code from scratch. We also built this project to practice using GitHub to work on a project with multiple collaborators, and working with multiple third-party and server-side APIs. 

-It offers a quick and easy way of finding information on movies and creating a list of movies that the user would like to watch in the future after learning.
